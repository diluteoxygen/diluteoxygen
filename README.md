  <em>hi there!</em>
</div>

I go by many names online, but most people know me as Oxygen. I code things, break things, and occasionally fix them.

## Currently

- Building random projects that seem cool at 2am
- Procrastinating on that one project I promised myself I'd finish
- Learning whatever catches my interest this week
- Probably listening to something like this:

</div>

## Some things I work with

JavaScript, Python, React, Node.js, and whatever else gets the job done. I'm not picky about tech stacks - good code is good code.

## Find me around the web
